Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight delays using machine learning models. The goal is to build a reliable prediction system that can help airlines, airports, and passengers better manage schedules by anticipating delays based on historical and real-time data.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical flight data, including:

Flight number

Departure and arrival times

Carrier information

Weather conditions

Distance between airports

Previous delay patterns

Source

The dataset can be sourced from public repositories like the U.S. Department of Transportation or Kaggle. Ensure that the dataset you use is clean and well-prepared for analysis.
Description of Key Files:

data_preprocessing.py: Script for cleaning and preparing the dataset.

model_training.py: Script for training machine learning models.

model_evaluation.py: Script for evaluating the performance of trained models.

notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.

models/: Stores trained models and associated files.

python src/model_evaluation.py

Model Selection

The following machine learning algorithms were tested:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

The best-performing model was Random Forest, which achieved the highest accuracy and reliability across different datasets.

Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Results

The Random Forest model achieved the best results, with an accuracy of 92%. The model successfully predicted delays based on historical data and real-time inputs.

Future Improvements

Incorporating real-time weather data using APIs

Expanding the dataset to include more features such as airport traffic and maintenance logs

Implementing a web-based interface for users to input flight details and get delay predictions
